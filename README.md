# Simple Image Hosting server 📸
A useless image hosting server that sends a completely different file depending on whether a bot or a user visits. Honestly a waste of cloud storage space.

# Explanation 📝
This script runs a local flask server (very inefficient and can only serve 1 request at a time) and serves different files depending on whether it is contacted
via a bot or actual user. The aim of this program is to try and somehow trick people into downloading your malicious executable (unrealistic scenario)
